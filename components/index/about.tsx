          My name is Brian Dashore, a student doctor and self-taught hobbyist developer. I am
          currently in pursuit of my DO degree with a specialization in immunology.
          <br />
          <br />
          From sixth grade, I was interested in medicine and learning how the human body works. Iâ€™ve
          always had an inherent desire to help people since so many helped me when I suffered
          through chronic illness. I have spent many years over studying biology, anatomy,
          nutrition, and other fields of medicine. Eventually, I was accepted to a BS/DO program in
          February of 2020 and have since matriculated into osteopathic medical school. From there,
          I am planning to study immunology and make a career/practice for myself.
          <br />
          <br />I have presented in various conferences in Harvard Spaulding Hospital, Autism One,
          and the International Mold Congress for CEU credits. If you would like to know more about
          my story, please go to{' '}

          On the developer side of things, I learned how to program in Python at age 15 and created
          a small mario-kart 2d-game in processing.py. However, I lost interest in programming due
          to a lack of project ideas. Eventually, I stumbled upon the Android community and built my
          own custom kernel in 2018 using C. In February of 2020, I started programming bots using
          the Discord, Twitch, and Twitter APIs. These bots are semi-popular, and I have designed
          them with goals of educating the public and making my social media life easier. The same
          principle applies to Apple applications that I created in to make various functions easier
          on end-user iDevices.

          <br />
          Currently, I work with AI and have dipped my toes into subfields such as Stable Diffusion
          and the use of LLMs for assistant related and character roleplay tasks.
          <br />
          <br />
          I feel that development ties well into medicine since learning multiple
          languages/principles will allow me to succeed in future medical careers and possibly
          create my own healthcare-oriented software.
