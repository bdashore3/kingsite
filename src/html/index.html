                My name is Brian Dashore, a self-taught hobbyist developer, and I am studying for a degree in medicine.
                I am currently located in Long Island, New York.
                <br>
                <br>
                From sixth grade, I was interested in medicine and learning how the human body works.
                I’ve always had an inherent desire to help people since so many helped me when I suffered through
                chronic illness.
                I have spent many years over studying biology, anatomy, nutrition, and other fields of medicine.
                Eventually, I was accepted to NYIT’s 7-year BS/DO program in February of 2020.
                I am currently studying there and will obtain my DO in 7 years.
                From there, I am planning to study immunology and make a career/practice for myself.
                <br>
                <br>
                I have presented in various conferences in Harvard Spaulding Hospital, Autism One, and the International
                Mold Congress for CEU credits.

                <br>
                My work as a developer started at age 15 where I learned how to program in Python and created a small
                mario-kart 2d-game in processing.py.
                However, I lost interest in programming due to a lack of project ideas.
                I stumbled upon the Android community and built my own custom kernel in 2018 using C.
                In February of 2020, I started programming bots using the Discord, Twitch, and Twitter APIs.
                These bots are semi-popular, and I have designed them with goals of educating the public and making my
                social media life easier.
                <br>
                <br>
                I feel that development ties well into medicine and learning multiple languages/principles will allow me
                to succeed
                in future medical careers and possibly create my own software.
