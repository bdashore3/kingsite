# My Website!

This is the source for my personal website [kingbri.me](https://kingbri.me).

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/1f44dfa4-6212-4b6e-9d6e-2c4e8ba083e0/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/eager-borg-3a4442/deploys)

## What do the parts use?

- Tailwind.css for easy CSS creation
- HTML for linking the webpage together
- Raw CSS for unique classes that can't be made using tailwind
- Next.js for a website framework

## Why is this not on Github Pages?

All external parts of the website are located on a VPS (files, api, etc)

This website is served on Netlify. It's a better alternative than Github Pages.

## Is it usable yet?

Since it's a static website, yes.
