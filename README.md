# My Website!

This is the source for my personal website [kingbri.me](https://kingbri.me).

## What do the parts use?

- Rocket-rs for providing a webserver in Rust
- Tailwind.css for easy CSS creation
- HTML for linking the webpage together
- Raw CSS for unique classes that can't be made using tailwind
- Next.js for a website framework
- Nginx (Not in the repo yet!) as a reverse-proxy on https/http

## Why is this not on Github Pages?

All external parts of the website are located on a VPS

This website is served on Netlify. It's a better alternative than Github Pages.

## Is it usable yet?

The website works, but with some extra steps.
