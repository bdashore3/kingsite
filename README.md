# My Website!

This is the source for my personal website [kingbri.me](kingbri.me).

Please do not reuse this without my permission.

This project is licensed under MPL2.

## What does it use?

- Rocket-rs for providing a webserver in Rust
- Tailwind.css for easy CSS creation
- HTML for linking the webpage together
- Raw CSS for unique classes that can't be made using tailwind
- Nginx (Not in the repo yet!) as a reverse-proxy on https/http

## Why is this not on Github Pages?

I will be adding many sub-pages to this website which will serve as internal/configuration panels for various projects. Therefore, hosting this website on pages is a huge pain. 

This is also why I am using Rocket instead of directly serving the HTML.

## Is it usable yet?

The website works, but with some extra steps.
